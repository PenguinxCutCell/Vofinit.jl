The grid cells can be cuboids of variable size. The implicit function f(x,y,z) is specified by the user: the interface is represented by the zero level set, f(x,y,z) == 0, and the reference phase is located where f(x,y,z) < 0.\n\nThis repository provides a thin Julia wrapper (Vofinit.jl) around the libvofi routines. Each routine in src/ contains a short description of what it does and the expected I/O variables.\n\nQuick start\n\nusing Vofinit\n\nf(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1.0\nx0 = [0.0,0.0,0.0]\nh0 = [1.0,1.0,1.0]\n\nct = getcelltype(f, x0, h0)\nval = getcc(f, x0, h0, [0.5,0.5,0.5])\n\nprintln(ct, \" \", val)\n\nSee the Reference page for API details.","category":"section"}]
